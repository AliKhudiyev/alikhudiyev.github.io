# The manifesto breakdown

I think most technical people hate having too many meetings, let alone
going through many other administrative processes. The faster way to win
here, at least in the short term, may be through cheating in some sense.
However, the system would fail in the long term because it pushes
forward the wrong incentives (cheating) instead of getting rid of
unnecessary meetings, calls, and other administrative processes. You may
argue whether cheating is a wrong thing to do in such cases, and the
answer could be \"no, it's not\". Although it may not be the \"wrong\"
thing to do, depending on the situation, it is not a good thing to be
pushed forward as an incentive. There is a difference: cheating as an
act and cheating as an incentive. People may be forced to cheat, and the
guilt of cheating would be on the system, reinforcing it, not on the
people doing it (at least not majorly). When looked at from this
perspective, there is some amount of guilt on the system because of how
the Cluely manifesto expresses the willingness to cheat on everything.
However, the manifesto does not use \"cheating\" to merely fire back at
the system; it also incentivizes it, effectively playing along with the
system. This is where everything starts to become perplexing.

> We built Cluely so you never have to think alone again. It sees your screen. Hears your audio. Feeds you answers in real time. While others guess --- you're already right.

The question here is to what extent people would be willing to give away
their privacy to be able to be \"already right\" while others are
guessing. Another thing is, would you want to sound right undeservingly?
Would you like to be a joke stealer? Seriously, though, is being right
even when you don't even know what right or wrong even means that
important? This could make a good Black Mirror episode, if there is not
one already; giving up your privacy to get hired by a company, only to
then realize how you have become a puppet of the company, and now you
are in serious trouble, facing the consequences if you do not do as they
order.

The calculator analogy may have already become the public defender of
cheating cases by using AI, but it is understood and used in the wrong
way almost all the time. There are still cases where using calculators
is considered cheating, such as K4 students passing their basic
arithmetic exam. There are still cases where using spellcheckers is
considered cheating, such as English writing classes. There are still
cases where using Google search is considered cheating, such as
closed-book university exams. I do not see how a kid is supposed to be
good at solving integrals without first understanding the first
principles of basic arithmetic. Are we literally turning into the
translator in the Chinese Room experiment? Using calculators is NOT
considered cheating for university students, for example, because they
already get it, and now it is a matter of efficiency. Using Google is
NOT considered cheating in cases where the point of using it is not to
copy and paste the thing you are interested in understanding, but
something fact memorization-related. Using a tool should be considered
constructive only when its use plays an intermediary role in bringing
more wisdom/understanding to the tool user, not when it doesn't help the
person to gain more understanding of the thing of interest. This is the
distinction between constructive and destructive ways of using tools.
The rule of thumb is to use a tool's output in the form of if
tool-output is true, then the-thing-of-my-interest is true/false,
followed by the question, why is tool-output true?, instead of
tool-output is true. If you cannot trace back the question of \"why the
tool output is true (or false)?\" to the things you already know or can
test on your own, then using the tool's output is destructive. It is
only constructive when it guides you through the realm of possibilities
efficiently, helping you to understand the thing of your interest to the
extent of making the tool itself obsolete to solve the problem, if
efficiency weren't concerned.

> > <h4>But this is different.</h4>

Indeed, this is a different case because AI stands for something that is
intelligent in an unspecified way, meaning it can adapt and get better
at doing any given task hypothetically. AI in its current form is not
yet there to completely redefine how our world works, but it might be
one day. So, I also believe it is more than just a calculator, or
Google, or probably any other tool that has ever been invented in human
history.

Why memorize facts? Almost no reason other than maybe you don't want to
get dementia or something when you get older. Why write code? Why
research anything? Okay, let's assume no good reason exists for a
minute. The best communicator, the best analyst, the best problem-solver
is now the one who knows how to ask the right question. Uhm, who is that
person going to be? The one with the dementia who couldn't write code
and didn't know how to conduct research properly? This sounds quite
illogical. You are telling me I don't need to use the rigorous language
of mathematics to be a better communicator? You're telling me that I
don't need to know coding and be capable of algorithmic thinking to be a
better problem-solver? This sounds even harder than learning how to
write code\...

> The future won't reward effort. It'll reward leverage.

This is already the case where putting too much effort into something
does not mean you'll get rewarded proportionally. There are multiple
aspects of this issue, however. One of the issues is that you should
pick the right tool to hammer down a nail; otherwise, you'll spend
enormously more time and effort than the guy doing it with a hammer.
This is one kind of leverage. The other kind of leverage would be using
your time to kill the other guy so that you would get the job by the
rule of elimination (pun intended), even if you couldn't hammer down
your nail properly. So, when it is framed simply as \"only leverage is
rewarded\", it can mean anything, even if it is doing harm to society to
get a job whose goal is to serve society. Not only that, but I also
think that the guy spending too much time \"unnecessarily\" because of
poor tool selection does not end up getting nothing beneficial out of
his experience; he may realize where the difficulty of using the fist
comes from and come up with a better tool to do the job the next time.
It may be the case that this person will outsmart the other person, who
just picked the hammer without giving it a second thought, in the long
run, because this person is purely focused on observing the process and
getting better at it, while the other person is just all about blindly
using what is available until what is available breaks, disappears, or
needs an improvement. The first person is a producer, the second one is
a blind consumer.

> > <h4>So, start cheating.</h4>

Maybe, just stop cheating. Because when everyone cheats, cowards start
to become the heroes of society, and the heroes become the cowards.
Because when everyone cheats, the world becomes even more unjust than it
already is, and dignity becomes a burden instead of something to look up
to. Because when everyone cheats, trust fades away, and honesty means
nothing while the jokers run around trolling everything.

I don't think the existence of the Cluely manifesto is \"just bad\".
Something has to break the reputation of the system (e.g., corporations)
in order to make it better and be prepared for the future. There is no
good without the bad and no bad without the good, where the good and the
bad are both good and bad.
