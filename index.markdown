        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a PhD Candidate in (Computationally Unbounded) AI from Strasbourg University. I love learning math and coding in C. I like to cook my own science for my own pleasure. I share my research, insights, tutorials, quizzes, and other fun things, through this blog.

<!-- Extended Biography -->
<section style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <h2>Career Path</h2>
    <p>
    I realized my deep interest in math and programming when I was a high school student at Turkiye Diyanat Vagfi - Baku Turskish Lyceum (TDV-BTL). After graduating from TDV-BTL, I began my journey in <i>Computer Science</i> with a BSc from French-Azerbaijani University (UFAZ) in 2016. Due to COVID breakdown, I started my MSc at UFAZ in <i>Data Science & Artificial Intelligence</i>. Then, I started my PhD at Strasbourg University in 2022, where I proposed working on making machine learning computationally unbounded by fixing the non-scalability of current AI scaling approaches. Currently, Iâ€™m an Engineer/Researcher at UFAZ and my research focus is revolving around the same/similar things that I did in my PhD.
