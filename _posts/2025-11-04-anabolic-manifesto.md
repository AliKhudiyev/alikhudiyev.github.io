We don't want to create super-intelligence because we are interested in
building one, but because we want to know we are *capable of creating
it*.

We don't want to become a millionaire because we love money, but because
we want to know we are *capable of having it*.

We don't want to travel the world because we are curious about how other
people live their lives, but because we want to know we are *capable of
adapting to different lifestyles*.

We don't want to read news and learn about history because we want to
know how the times have changed, but because we want to know we are
*capable of making one*.

We don't want to do sports because we want to show off in public, but
because we want to know we are *capable of challenging ourselves
regularly*.

We don't want to watch art because we want to buy it, but because we
want to know we are *capable of making our own art*.

We don't want to do it because of \*it\*, but because we want to know we
are *capable of doing it*.

Everything is an excuse to feed our hunger. We don't do it for
reputation or positive public opinions, we do it to feed our starving
minds with a meaning to live for.
